# Acid-Atom-Predictor-SVM

This repository contains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model developed for predicting the number of acid atoms in molecules based on their molecular features. The SVM algorithm is trained on a dataset comprising various molecular descriptors and corresponding acid atom counts. The predictive model utilizes machine learning techniques to classify molecules and estimate the presence of acid atoms. The repository includes code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction. Additionally, it provides documentation and examples to facilitate understanding and usage. Whether you're a researcher exploring molecular properties or a developer interested in predictive modeling, this repository offers insights and tools for acid atom prediction using SVM.
